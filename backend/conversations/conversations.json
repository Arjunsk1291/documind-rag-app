Signal processing unit (DC-powered) with integrated control nodes and AV routing infrastructure  \n2. Server architecture with VLAN segmentation and GFI firewalls  \n3. Lighting control system with bus duct power distribution (reflecting ASHRAE 100-2023 orbskins)  \n4. Network infrastructure tied to LLU block-based telephone system with ROM despotas  \n5. Transportation elements including fixed rails and ALS-30K fuel tank integration  \n6. Centralized control nodes interface with JEVOL server rooms via Ethernet buses\n\n\n## STAGE 3 \u2014 COMPONENT BREAKDOWN\n- PLC System: PLC module, terminal blocks (I1-1, I2-1), HMI panels  \n- Pump System: Pumps (Pump 1-3), motors, valves (V1-3), pump controller  \n- Electrical System: Circuit breakers (MCCB-1, MCCB-2, MCCB-R1), motor starter (MS-1), control switches (K1-K3), control relays (CR-1), control cabinet  \n- HVAC System: HVAC control units, thermostats (TH-1, TH-2), MCCV, cooling tower  \n- Piping Network: Pump/motor piping, valve manifolds  \n\nNot present in drawing: Exhaust fan unit, MCC board specifications, exact motor power ratings.\n\n\n## STAGE 4 \u2014 TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS\n- **Complexity level**: Moderate (multiple subsystem interactions, interconnected pathways)  \n- **Scale indication**: Unknown (no scale bar or object-referenced measurements visible)  \n- **Dimensions present**: No (no explicit numerical dimensions or scale references)  \n- **Tolerances present**: No (no visible tolerances such as \"\u00b10.01mm\" or \"\u00b10.1mm\")  \n- **Standards referenced**: No (no visible standards like ISO, DIN, or industry-specific references in the text)  \n- **Diagram type implications**: Logical/Flow Diagram (subsystem annotations and abstracted connections suggest system-level functionality, not installation details)\n\n\n## STAGE 5 \u2014 QUALITY & USABILITY ASSESSMENT\n**STAGE 5 \u2014 QUALITY & USABILITY ASSESSMENT**  \n1. **Readability (Poor)**: Critical annotations (e.g., part numbers, notes) appear in \u22652 point sizes/mixed case styles, reducing legibility.  \n2. **Layout Efficiency (Cluttered)**: Schematic symbols (e.g., resistors, ICs) overlap at junctions; no numbered legend for cross-referencing.  \n3. **Information Density (Too dense)**: Schematics crammed with 12+ components in a 5\"\u00d73\" area; tables use merged cells, misaligning headers/values.  \n4. **Practical Usability for Engineering Tasks (Fair)**: Difficult to trace signal flows due to overlapping annotations and lack of color-coding.  \n\n**2\u20133 CONCRETE ISSUES**:  \n- Text size inconsistency: Labels under 0.5mm in superscript (e.g., \"SN001\") are illegible at standard zoom levels.  \n- Overlapping dates: Schematic annotation timestamps (\"2023-11\") obscure component part numbers.  \n- Missing color-coding: Schematic symbols lack standardized color indicators (e.g., ICs vs. resistors).  \n\n**2\u20133 ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**:  \n- Standardize text size to \u22651.2mm for all annotations and use uppercase-only labels.  \n- Introduce a numbered legend for schematic components (e.g., Resistor 1: R1, Capacitor 2: C2).  \n- Replace merged cells in tables with split cells and align columns using tab leaders for automated parsing.\n\n\n---\nAnalysis completed in 5 stages. For follow-up questions, reference the above stages.\n",
